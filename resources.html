        <div class="about-solar-para">
        <p>Solar system, assemblage consisting of the Sun—an average star in the
            Milky Way Galaxy—and those bodies orbiting around it: 8 (formerly 9)
            planets with more than 210 known planetary satellites (moons); many
            asteroids, some with their own satellites; comets and other icy bodies; and
            vast reaches of highly tenuous gas and dust known as the interplanetary
            medium. The solar system is part of the &quot;observable universe,&quot; the region of
            space that humans can actually or theoretically observe with the aid of
            technology. Unlike the observable universe, the universe is possibly infinite.</p>

        <h2>Planets:</h2>
        <p>Planets are celestial bodies that orbit stars, and in our solar system, the Sun
            is the central star around which planets orbit. Each planet has its unique set
            of features, characteristics, and conditions that make it distinct. Here&#39;s a
            brief overview of the planets in our solar system and some of their key

                <p>The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a
                    more live-able planet by moderating our home planet&#39;s wobble on its axis,
                    leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm
                    that has guided humans for thousands of years. The Moon was likely
                    formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth several billion years
                    ago. Earth&#39;s only natural satellite is simply called &quot;the Moon&quot; because
                    people didn&#39;t know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered
                    four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. In Latin, the Moon was called Luna,
                    which is the main adjective for all things Moon-related: lunar.</p>

                    asteroids or other debris from early in the formation of our solar system.
                    Phobos is the larger of Mars&#39; two moons. It orbits Mars three times a day,
                    and is so close to the planet&#39;s surface that in some locations on Mars it
                    cannot always be seen. Phobos is nearing Mars at a rate of six feet (1.8
                    meters) every hundred years. At that rate, it will either crash into Mars in
                    50 million years or break up into a ring. Deimos is the smaller moon. It
                    orbits Mars every 30 hours.</p>

                    in our solar system. Io&#39;s surface is a mesmerizing blend of vibrant colors,
                    primarily due to its extensive volcanic activity. It boasts the remarkable
                    
                    distinction of being the most volcanically active body in our solar system.
                    Its surface is marred by hundreds of volcanoes, continuously spewing forth
                    plumes of sulfur and other materials into space. These eruptions create a

                        which conceals a global subsurface ocean beneath. Europa experiences tidal
                        heating due to the gravitational forces exerted by Jupiter and its sister
                        moons. This process generates heat within Europa&#39;s interior, keeping its
                        subsurface ocean in a liquid state.</ol></p>

                    varied terrain, which includes deep canyons, towering cliffs, and large
                    impact craters. The chaotic terrain on Miranda suggests a history of

                    suggests that it was likely captured by Neptune&#39;s gravitational pull, rather
                    than forming in orbit around the planet. Triton&#39;s surface is a mix of icy

                    gases. Its atmosphere extends above the surface, and it results in a faint,
